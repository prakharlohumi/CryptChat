This is a practice project built by me to brush my JAVA Skills.
It utilises JAVA multithreading, socket programming and DBMS with MySQL to host a session between two users to chat/share files encrypted
using AES/DES and digitally signed using SHA256 and RSA.
The public key of users is stored in a Relational Database.
